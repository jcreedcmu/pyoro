This is an old game idea I've been tinkering with from time to time.
The premise is: puzzle-platformer, but time is discrete, so there's
no need to have good twitch skills.

Present influences on my mind include
- [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/)
- [Isles of Sea and Sky](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1233070/Isles_of_Sea_and_Sky/)
- [Time Badgers](https://github.com/gwillen/timebadgers)
- [Leap Year](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951770/Leap_Year/)
- [Stephen's Sausage Roll](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353540/Stephens_Sausage_Roll/)
- Classic platformers like Mario, Sonic, etc.

## Interesting Corner Cases

Should probably turn these into puzzle ideas.

- Diagonal-up pushing of a button
- Diagonal-crossing of a block
- Skimming just behind a phased transient block
- Running off the edge of a platform and then back to get enough
  combo momentum for something
